# 🌐 Remade site
I recently remade from scratch my **entire site**. Why? Well, it was really bad : inconsistencies, bad looking and more.
## Now, what changed?
To be honest, everything. Here is a list of it :
- **Modern design** : If you look at my old site, it was pretty bad. And it was my first ever site. See it [here](https://github.com/TotoCodeFR/TotoCodeFR.github.io/tree/156a934105954f648cfebf2b07904b065994b0e3).
- **Fully updated documentation** : I fully update this documentation every single update (maybe showing every version of documentation 👀)
