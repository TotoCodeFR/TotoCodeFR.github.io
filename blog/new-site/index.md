# üåê Remade site
I recently remade from scratch my **entire site**. Why? Well, it was really bad : inconsistencies, bad looking and more.
## Now, what changed?
Well, to be honest, everything. The main page, the documentation, made a new blog that you are watching right now, fully open source @ [my profile](https://github.com/TotoCodeFR/TotoCodeFR.github.io)
